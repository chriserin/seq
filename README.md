# sq

A powerful MIDI sequencer designed for the command line

## Overview

sq is a terminal-based MIDI sequencer that brings midi sequencer capabilities to your CLI. Built with Go and designed for efficiency, sq offers rapid beat creation, complex arrangements, and advanced pattern manipulation through an intuitive keyboard-driven interface.

## Key Features

- **MIDI Integration**: Control hardware or software instruments via MIDI
- **Rapid Beat Creation**: Create drum patterns in just a few keystrokes using pattern mode
- **Advanced Overlays**: Add mathematical variations to sequences with the overlay system
- **Flexible Arrangements**: Structure songs with sections, parts and groups
- **Real-time Manipulation**: Modify patterns, accents, gates and timing while playing
- **Vim-inspired**: Familiar key bindings for efficient workflow

## Install from package

Pre-built packages for macOS and Linux are found on the [Releases](https://github.com/chriserin/sq/releases) page.

## Install with mise:

```
mise install ubi:chriserin/sq
```

## Quick Start

1. **Launch sq**: `sq`
2. **Create a beat**: Move cursor with `hjkl`, press `1` for notes on every beat
3. **Play**: Press `Space` to play/stop
4. **Save**: `Ctrl+s` to save your sequence

### Basic Beat Creation Example

Create a basic beat with just 6 keystrokes:

- Bass drum: cursor on BD line, press `8` (note every 8 beats)
- Snare: `j` (down), `4` then `8` (note every 8 beats starting at beat 5)
- Hi-hat: `j` (down), `1` (note every beat)

The resulting sequence will look like this:

```
BDK┤▧       ▧       ▧       ▧
SN │    ▧       ▧       ▧       ▧
H1 │▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧▧
```

## Configuration

sq uses Lua for configuration. Configuration files can be located in 4 different locations:

- `./`
- `./config/`
- `~/.sq/`
- `~/.config/sq/`

If a configuration file is not found, an initial configuration is written to `~/.confing/init.lua`.

## Development

### Build from Source

#### Dependencies MACOS

```
# Lua 5.4
brew install lua@5.4-dev
```

#### Dependencies Linux

```
sudo apt-get install liblua5.4-dev
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
```

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chriserin/sq.git
cd sq

# Build with Lua support
go build -tags lua54 -o sq

# Run
./sq
```

#### Building

```bash

# All commands must use -tags lua54
go build -tags lua54 -o sq
go test -tags lua54 ./...
go fmt ./...

# Consider exporting a GOFLAGS variable to avoid including `-tags lua54` for every command
export GOFLAGS="-tags=lua54"
```
