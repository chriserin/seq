# SEQ

A midi sequencer for your cli

## What is it?

A trigger sequencer that runs in your terminal (I use ghostty) and uses key
presses to create rhythms.

## Key Concepts

- Numbers 1 â€“ 9 are used to establish triggers at every nth beat
- Accents, mapped to velocity, can be added in the same way in Accent Mode
- Key Cycles define how many times the pattern has cycles
- Overlays provide variation to a pattern based on the key cycles
